Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application
Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.


Start by converting your Jupyter notebook into a Python script called scrape_mars.py with a function called scrape that will execute 
all of your scraping code from above and return one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.

Next, create a route called /scrape that will import your scrape_mars.py script and call your scrape function.


Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.


Create a root route / that will query your Mongo database and pass the mars data into an HTML template to display the data.
Create a template HTML file called index.html that will take the mars data dictionary and display all of the data in the 
appropriate HTML elements. Use the following as a guide for what the final product should look like, but feel free to create your 
own design.-->
